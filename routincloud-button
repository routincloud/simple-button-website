# Routin Cloud (Very Very Basic Button for Websites)

This button is very easy to use. It’s the first version, so it may need improvement, but it’s the best button for editing with a basic concept of JavaScript. Use the `getbutton.js` file on your website, and it will load `code.js` from the JSON file. You can edit the WhatsApp numbers you want to display, preview websites, and use forms thanks to Formspree.
